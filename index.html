									<p><span><a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images/Astrid and I.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>I’m a Postdoctoral fellow at Brown University in the <a href="https://elizabeth-brainerd.squarespace.com/"> Brainerd Lab </a> as well as a new mom! I’m a fish enthusiast, fluid dynamicist, and biomechanist. Specifically, I am interested in the relationship between functional morphology and fluid dynamics. In this, understanding the influence of specific movements on the fluid and the flow that is consequently produced that may indicate levels of performance. </p>
<p>My current research explores the intraoral flow during feeding, examining the potential alignment of food and efficiency of feeding in Notopteridae. Stick around to find out what I discover. <b>You can contact me at corrine_avidan@brown.edu.</b></p>

										<h2>Amazing Seahorses</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/seahorse suction.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Suction feeding is a dominant prey-capture strategy across actinopterygians, consisting of a rapid expansion of the mouth cavity that drives a flow of water containing the prey into the mouth. Suction feeding is a power-hungry behavior, involving the actuation of cranial muscles as well as the anterior third of the fish’s swimming muscles. Seahorses, which have reduced swimming muscles, evolved a unique mechanism for elastic energy storage that powers their suction flows. This mechanism allows seahorses to achieve head rotation speeds that are 50 times faster than those of fish lacking such a mechanism. However, it is unclear how the dynamics of suction flows in seahorses differ from the conserved pattern observed across other actinopterygians, or how differences in snout length across seahorses affect these flows. Using flow visualization experiments, we show that seahorses generate suction flows that are 8 times faster than those of similar-sized fish, and that the temporal patterns of cranial kinematics and suction flows in seahorses differ from the conserved pattern observed across other actinopterygians. However, the spatial patterns retain the conserved actinopterygian characteristics, where suction flows impact a radially symmetric region of ∼1 gape diameter outside the mouth. Within seahorses, increases in snout length were associated with slower suction flows and faster head rotation speeds, resulting in a trade-off between pivot feeding and suction feeding. Overall, this study shows how the unique cranial kinematics in seahorses are manifested in their suction-feeding performance, and highlights the trade-offs associated with their unique morphology and mechanics.</p>

										<h2>Comparative Functional<br/> Morphology</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Suction feeding is a widespread prey capture strategy among aquatic vertebrates. It is almost omnipresent across fishes, and has repeatedly evolved in other aquatic vertebrates. By rapidly expanding the mouth cavity, suction feeders generate a fluid flow outside of their mouth, drawing prey inside. Fish and other suctionfeeding organisms display remarkable trophic diversity, echoed in the diversity of their skull and mouth morphologies. Yet, it is unclear how variable suction flows are across species, and whether variation in suction flows supports trophic diversity. Using a high-speed flow visualization technique, we characterized the spatio-temporal patterns in the flow fields produced during feeding in 14 species of aquatic suction feeders. We found that suction-feeding hydrodynamics are highly conserved across species. Suction flows affected only a limited volume of ∼1 gape diameter away from the mouth, and peaked around the timing of maximal mouth opening. The magnitude of flow speed increased with increasing mouth diameter and, to a lesser extent, with decreasing time to peak gape opening. Other morphological, kinematic and behavioral variables played a minor role in shaping suction-feeding dynamics. We conclude that the trophic diversity within fishes, and likely other aquatic vertebrates, is not supported by a diversity of mechanisms that modify the characteristics of suction flow. Rather, we suggest that suction feeding supports such trophic diversity owing to the general lack of strong trade-offs with other mechanisms that contribute to prey capture.</p>
